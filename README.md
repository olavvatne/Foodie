AngularJS has an elegant structure to it, and enables developers to make more modern web-pages that are more like deskop-applications in the sense that you can do a lot on one page without reloading all the time. AngularJS is gaining popularity quickly, and with good reason.

AngularJS lets you extend HTML vocabulary for your application. The resulting environment is extraordinarily expressive, readable, and quick to develop."
