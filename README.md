Technologies used:

*AngularJs*


AngularJS is an open-source web application framework maintained by Google and a community of individual developers and corporations to help the process of building powerful, high-quality single-page applications be as easy as possible.
AngularJS has an elegant structure to it, and enables developers to make more modern web-pages that are more like deskop-applications in the sense that you can do a lot on one page without reloading all the time. AngularJS is gaining popularity quickly, and with good reason.

On their webpage they write: "HTML is great for declaring static documents, but it falters when we try to use it for declaring dynamic views in web-applications. AngularJS lets you extend HTML vocabulary for your application. The resulting environment is extraordinarily expressive, readable, and quick to develop."

Using Angular is more complicated than making a static webpage, and although some of the challenges related to making the site dynamic and not having to reload when the user visits another page of the site is abstracted away, everything is coded/written by hand.

*Bootstrap*


Bootstrap is a free collection of tools for creating websites and web applications. It contains CSS for typography, forms, buttons, navigation and other interface components, as well as optional JavaScript extensions. It also includes a grid-system for structuring content.
We have used it for styling mostly.

*SASS*


Sass is a scripting language that "compiles" to CSS. It enables you to make styles in a more efficient and organized way than when writing in CSS.

*XML*


The faq section of the site uses XML data. This demonstrate well how a web page
made in AngularJs should handle an API endpoint that only serves XML data.



*Form Controls*

There a three different forms for this webpage. A recipe, group and account
registration form. All forms contain validation functionality, and displays
the errors either when attempting to submit or when a form element loses it's
focus. The latter approch offer a more instant form of feedback to the user.

Custom validation for some elements has also been created. The recipe form
for example requires that the user has at least added one ingredient and at least
one recipe step before submitting the form.
