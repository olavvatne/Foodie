Technologies used:

*AngularJs*


AngularJS is an open-source web application framework maintained by Google and a community of individual developers and corporations to help the process of building powerful, high-quality single-page applications be as easy as possible.
AngularJS has an elegant structure to it, and enables developers to make more modern web-pages that are more like deskop-applications in the sense that you can do a lot on one page without reloading all the time. AngularJS is gaining popularity quickly, and with good reason.

On their webpage they write: "HTML is great for declaring static documents, but it falters when we try to use it for declaring dynamic views in web-applications. AngularJS lets you extend HTML vocabulary for your application. The resulting environment is extraordinarily expressive, readable, and quick to develop."

*Bootstrap*


Bootstrap is a free collection of tools for creating websites and web applications. It contains CSS for typography, forms, buttons, navigation and other interface components, as well as optional JavaScript extensions. It also includes a grid-system for structuring content.
We have used it for styling mostly.

*CSS*


For the project we used alot of custom styles and almost everything you see on the page is hand-written.

*SASS*


Sass is a CSS extension scripting language that "compiles" to CSS. It enables you to make styles in a more efficient and organized way than when writing in CSS. SASS has a wide variaty of addiotional functions including mixins, functions, inheritance, and control structures and statements like "if" "else" "for" etc. This makes it feel more like a full programming-language, not just markup, and opens for much more modular and dynamic markup.

For organizing the markup, we used the SMACSS architecture, where the markup are divided into many partial files that are organized into category-folders and imported from the main style-sheet.

*Compass*


Compass is a SASS-extension with many helpful mixins to make your life easier while writing markup. The mixins we used for this project are browser related, specifically for transitions, transformations and image-treatment. For example if you want a gradient background you would have to write the same effect multiple times with fallback for all browsers (webkit, moz, etc.). What Compass does is to generate all possible fallbacks for you, it will even write experimental hacks to simulate the effect in "stone-aged"-browsers without the support for it.
